# Random Password Generator

## Description 

This project was brought about because of the occasionally need to create secure passwords. Thinking of a random password on your own isn't always as easy as it seems. Thanks to this simple and easy to use web application, you will never have to again.

This web application is a random password generator that allows a user to specify customized features of their password including the length of the password (8-128 characters), as well if the password should include upper-case, lower-case, numbers and/or special characters.

Although this application appears simple from the GUI perspective, the nuts and bolts under the hood created a challenging experience that required some extensive thought and problem-solving to get it to work properly. I learned that itâ€™s always a good idea to conduct due diligence by completing a thorough pseudocoding to map out the project beforehand.
